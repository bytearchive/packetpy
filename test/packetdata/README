This directory contains sample packet data used to test packet decoding.

The rule of thumb for gathering packet data types is that the link layer type
MUST be Ethernet if the packet dump is relevant to all platforms. This is due
to the fact that there is a conflict in the way Loopback and Raw link layer
type identifiers are defined in Linux and OpenBSD.
