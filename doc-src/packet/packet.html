<p> Each packet is represented as an instance of the <b>Packet</b> class.
Conceptually, each <b>Packet</b> instance acts like a stack of protocols,
starting with the protocol at the beginning of the packet, and continuing
through all the enclosed protocols to the end of the packet. So, for example,
an ICMP packet from a PF log might consist of the following stacked protocols:
</p>

<p>
	<b>
		pf -&gt; Ethernet -&gt; IP -&gt; ICMP
	</b>
</p>

<p> It is the task of the <b>Protocol</b> class to make the protocols in this
stack easy to access and manipulate. </p>


<h2> Interface </h2>

	<h3>Protocol(klass, packet)</h3>

	<p><b>klass</b> is a protocol class matching the first protocol in the
	protocol stack. <b>packet</b> is raw packet data as a Python string. </p> 

	<h3>__len__()</h3>

	<p> Return the length of the underlying packet data in 8 bit characters. </p>

	<h3>__repr__()</h3>

	<p> Return a human-readable representation of the packet. </p>

	<h3>getProtoList()</h3>

	<p> Retrieves a list of all protocol objects in the protocol stack. </p>


	<h3>getRaw()</h3>

	<p> Retrieves the raw packet as a string. </p>


	<h3>finalise()</h3>

	<p> Fixes calculated packet elements, including offsets, checksums, etc.
	This method should be called after packet contents have been modified. </p>


	<h3>__getitem__(protocol)</h3>

	<p> Case-insensitive retrieval of protocols from the protocol stack by
	name. For example, the following retrieves the first IP protocol class
	found in the stack:</p>
	
	<!--(block example)-->
# p is a Packet instance
p["ip"]
	<!--(end)-->
@!colourPython(example)!@

	<p> Note that the individual protocol instances provide an interface
	polymorphic to this. Say we had a packet which contained IP-over-IP
	tunneled traffic. To retrieve the inner IP packet, we would use the
	following shorthand: </p>

	<!--(block example)-->
# p is a Packet instance
p["ip"]["ip"]
	<!--(end)-->
@!colourPython(example)!@

	<p> The first example can be read as "retrieve the first IP protocol class
	contained in the packet". The second example can be read as "retriee the
	first IP protocol class contained within the first IP protocol class in the
	packet".</p>

	<h3>has_key(protocol)</h3>

	<p>Case-insensitive name-based check for the existence of a given protocol
	in the packet.</p>
