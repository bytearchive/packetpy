<p> Simply put, a descriptor is a window to a specific piece of protocol
information. Consider an address field in an IP protocol header. On the wire,
IPv4 addresses are represented as 4 network-ordered bytes. A user attempting to
view the address in this format would quickly find that the byte representation
is not very meaningful - it would have to be converted to the familiar dotted
quad notation before it could comfortably be worked with.  The same would be
true if the user wanted to change the address - rather than specifying the byte
string in the raw, the user would want to supply the address in human-readable
format.  To ease the type of interaction described above, we could add an extra
layer between the user and the data. The layer would convert from the
underlying representation to a human-readable notation on the way out, and do
the converse on the way in. This layer is a descriptor. Each individual
protocol class can be viewed as a set of descriptors that allow the user to
interact with the underlying data.</p>



<p> The following descriptor types are used in the <b>packet</b> module.
Documentation for each descriptor type can be accessed by typing
