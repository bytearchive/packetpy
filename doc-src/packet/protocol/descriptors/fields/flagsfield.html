<p> A FlagsField is a subclass of BitField that represent a field of n binary flags.  A good example of a FlagsField
is the IP flags field which has 3 distinct binary flags  [MF | DF | RES ].
</p>

<h2> Interface </h2>

	<h3>FlagsField()</h3>

	<p> The <b>FlagsField</b> class is used to repesent the binary flag fields that frequently occur in protocol headers. </p>

	<h3>__get__()</h3>

	<p> Return the value of the field as an integer. </p>

	<h3>__set__(val)</h3>

	<p> The value of a FlagsField can be set in several different ways.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Pass a list of int values which can be bit-wise OR'd together to provide a value for the field.  A fictitious example would be providing [ 1, 2, 4 ] for an 8 bit field.  Giving a field value of 7 (00000111). </li>
        <!--(block example)-->
# p is a Packet instance
# to turn on all flags
p["ip"].flags[1,2,4]
        <!--(end)-->
        @!colourPython(example)!@

      <li>Pass a string which name of the state you want to set the field to.  E.G proto[fieldname] = "state"</li>
        <!--(block example)-->
# p is a Packet instance
# to turn on all flags
p["ICMP6NeighbourAdvertisement"].flags = "ROUTER"
        <!--(end)-->
        @!colourPython(example)!@
      
      <li>Pass an int value which represent the binary state you want to set the field to. </li>
        <!--(block example)-->
# p is a Packet instance
# to turn on all flags
p["IP"].flags = 7
        <!--(end)-->
        @!colourPython(example)!@
    </ul>
