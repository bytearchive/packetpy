<p> Each protocol in the protocol stack is an instance of a class derived from
the Protocol class. In addition to the standard interface documented below,
each descendant of the Protocol class typically makes available a myriad of
properties and methods for querying and manipulating a specific protocol. For
example, one class derived from <b>Protocol</b> is the <b>TCP</b> class, which
exposes a property <b>srcPort</b>. </p>


<h2> Interface </h2>

	<h3>Protocol()</h3>

	<p> The <b>Protocol</b> class and its decendants should not be instantiated
	by the user. </p>

	<h3>__repr__()</h3>

	<p> Return a human-readable representation of the protocol. </p>

	<h3>__getitem__(protocol)</h3>

	<p> Case-insensitive retrieval of protocols from the protocol stack by
	name. See the <b>Packet</b> class documentation for more information. </p>

	<h3>__len__(protocol)</h3>

	<p>Case-insensitive name-based check for the depth of the protocol stack beneath
	this protocol.</p>
	
	<h3>has_key(protocol)</h3>

	<p>Case-insensitive name-based check for the existence of a given protocol
	within this protocol.</p>
