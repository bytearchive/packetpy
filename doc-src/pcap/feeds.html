<p> PCap feeds come in two flavours - Live and Offline. Live feeds capture
packets from a network interface, while Offline feeds capture packets from a
file. The two types of feed share a common interface, which is documented
below. The sections discussing Live and Offline themselves only document
departures from and additions to this common interface.</p> 

<h2> Interface </h2>

A PCap Feed has the following methods:

<h3> dispatch(cnt, callback, interpret=0) </h3>
	
	<p> Collect and process packets. The <b>cnt</b> parameter specifies the
	number of packets to capture before returning. A <b>cnt</b> of -1 processes
	all the packets recieved in one buffer. A <b>cnt</b> of 0 processes all
	packets until an error occurs, EOF is reached, or the read times out (when
	doing Live feeds, and a non-zero timeout is specified). The <b>callback</b>
	parameter is a function with the interface <b>callback(packet, tstamp,
	length)</b>. It is called for each packet recieved, where <b>packet</b>
	will be the packet captured (up to the specified snaplength), <b>tstamp</b>
	will be a timestamp of the format <b>(seconds, useconds)</b>, and length
	will be the total length of the packet. If the <b>interpret</b> flag is
	true, an instantiated Packet (see the Packet subsystem documentation) is
	passed to the callback, instead of the binary packet data.

<h3> loop(cnt, callback, interpret=0) </h3>

	<p> Similar to <b>dispatch</b>, except that it keeps reading packets until
	<b>cnt</b> packets are read, or an error occurs. If the <b>interpret</b>
	flag is true, an instantiated Packet (see the Packet subsystem
	documentation) is passed to the callback, instead of the binary packet
	data.</p>

<h3> next(interpret=0) </h3>

	<p> Retrieve the next packet, by calling dispatch with a <b>cnt</b> of 1.
	If the <b>interpret</b> flag is true, an instantiated Packet (see the
	Packet subsystem documentation) is passed to the callback, instead of the
	binary packet data.</p>

<h3> inject(packet) </h3>

	<p>Write a new packet through the network interface. </p>

<h3> datalink() </h3>
	
	<p> Returns the data link layer type. The following Data Link Types are
	defined in the pcap module (see include/net/bpf.h): </p>

					<li>DLT_NULL</li>

					<li>DLT_PFLOG</li>       
			</ul>

<h3> filter(filterstr) </h3>
	
	<p> Apply a filter to the pcap feed. The syntax of <b>filterstr</b> is the
	same as that of tcpdump, and is documented extensively in the tcpdump(8)
	manpage.</p>

<h3> close() </h3>

	<p> Close the feed. For many applications you will not have to call this
	method explicitly - feeds will be closed automatically when they are
	collected by the Python garbage collector. </p>
