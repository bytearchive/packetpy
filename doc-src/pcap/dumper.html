<p> The Dumper class is used to write pcap dumps to file. </p>


<h2> Interface </h2>


<h3> Dumper(feed, file) </h3>

	<p> Dumper is instantiated with the following arguments: 

			<ul>

				<li> <b>feed</b> - An instance of the <b>Live</b> or
				<b>Offline</b> classes.

				<li> <b>file</b> - A filename to write to.

			</ul>


<h3> __call__(packet, tstamp, length) </h3>

	<p> A Dumper instance can be called like a function, with the following
	arguments: 

			<ul>

				<li> <b> packet </b> - The packet to be dumped, as a string. 

				<li> <b> tstamp </b> - A timestamp tuple of the form (seconds,
				useconds). 

				<li> <b> length </b> - The original length of the packet.

			</ul>

	Note that this is the same interface as that of the <b>callback</b>
	argument to the <b>loop</b> and <b>dispatch</b> methods on PCap feeds.</p>

<h3> close() </h3>

	<p> Close the dump. </p>


<h2> Example </h2>

<p> The example program below does the following: 
	
			<ul>
				<li> Opens an Live feed on an interface. </li>
				<li> Opens a dump from the Live feed to the file "dump".</li>
				<li> Captures 10 packets, writing them to the file. </li>
			</ul>
</p>
